SENTINEL Hub dataset

sentinel Hub Sentinel + copernicus
eo-learn

sentinel 2
revisit time 5 days
10 m resolution
-> not clear (CLOUDS!)

sentinel 1
revisit time 6 days
20m resolution
see through clouds
rather complicated data


Problems

spectral bands -> Cloud filtering
  atmospheric correction

Geopositional accuracy: image shake a little
