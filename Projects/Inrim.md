It's working on Galileo timing aspects

**GNSS** = Global Navigation Satellite System.

The gps position it's computed via triangulation, in order to calculate the distance it's used a signal time of flight.

> 3ns time error = 1m position error

an atomic clock is made of a crystal oscillator, with a frequency locked to the frequency of a narrow atomic transitions

> microwave to optical freq.

Environmental parameters can affect the stability of atomic clock.

**Distance calculate**

$D = c(t_{rec} - t_{sat} ) + iono + tropo + \gamma$
c speed of light in vacuum

$\gamma$ other
ionospere
tropospere

affected by signal propagation

Space weather it's related to solar activity:
+ geomagnetic storms (earth magnetic field perturbation)
+ proton events
+ x-ray flares

correlation observed behaviour of GNSS satellite clocks and space weather events

Time and frequency offset of GNSS satellite clocks with a stable ground reference clocks

Apparent clock data
measurement
unsynchronised data processing side effects

differentiationg time offset data to optain frequency offset dataset

deterministic component

apparent clock data anomalies:
+ time jumps
+ frequency jumps
+ drift change
+ variance changes
+ other frequency fluctuations

GOAL: find correlation between clock anomalies and space weather events
time-tag, clock dataset

sampling time 200 s

two files for each satellite clock

treat different clock for each satellite as a different one

time offset
