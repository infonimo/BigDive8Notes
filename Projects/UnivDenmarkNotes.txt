polar region
ice charting
-SAR data
melt water on top of ice similar to the ocean, difficult to distinct
uniform smooth ice, new ice, icebergs (to not consider)
predict ice concentration, ice type, fraction
Ice egg, numbers on the top


Ice analyst
see multiple information to classify ice optical,
 passive microvawe SIC ,thermal-infrared, SAR(radar)

using ArcGis/SIKU

in polar region a lot of clouds
-
result pdf with map
ice moves! The sooner


sun reflect and blind optical sensor
but radar measures (the intensity of the return signal as a function of time
 (translate to a function of distance))
it see thought clouds!

SENTINEL 1

dataset two layers of dataset H and H+V
incidence angle

more rough it's the ice more the incident wawe is big (more return)

amplitude vs incidence angle
varies a lot with incidence angle, speed, relative wind direction

radarsat
automated production of icecharts

multi temporal
SAR backscatter of ocean varies with incidence angle wind speed and direction
sar backscatter form ice varies with incidence angle

dataset NetCDF files
some HH
Some HV
+incidence angles
